        To run this version of Stick Fighter II you will need a very fast
computer (A 486 DX 66mhz should work fine), .5 megs of hard disk space, and
256k of free conventional RAM. The new version will be nearly twice as fast
and will have an option to make the animation 15 frames per second instead
of 30 fps to further double the speed. 

       The name you type in must be a valid dos file name (up to 8 letters).
If that name has already been used, the game will load up to that last place
the fighter under that name left off. (This is the equivelent of loading a
game.) After each fight your game will automatically be saved. If you win
a fight you will move up one rank, but if you lose you will move down 2.
When you fight the Sensi, he will take on the attributes of the next fighter
you have to face, but you will neither gain nor lose rank fighting him.
There are 14 World Warriors to challenge your skill (15 including yourself).
You can forfeit during a match by hitting q twice.
