II. GENERAL SUGGESTIONS
-Familiarize yourself with the keys on the early opponents. Be able to the 
move you want when you want to.
-Try alternating by blocking a move, then attacking.
-Try not to block until your opponent has actually started his move, because
he will pick a move that will get around your block.
-Keep your enemy guessing, and keep moving at all times.
-The flying elbow is useful to smack the enemy when he's jumping
and even if it is blocked it still will cause 2.5 damage
-Even though ducking is easier at first because it only has one block,
standing is a more powerful position so get comfortable in it too.
-Jumping can be very useful, but it takes time to get into the air so
treat it as you would your other moves. (Ex. Block, then jump)
-Always try to smack the enemy when he is getting up. High Kick gives
you the most damage and is easily possible
-Use the Sensi to get to know your next opponent before you fight him and
risk a loss
-Jump kick is generally the best way to get close to an opponent
-When your opponent is far down, duck punch is the safest move to send him
to his grave without too much risk. Shove isn't bad either.

Cheap Trick- You can copy to another directory your save game, then copy it 
back to Stick Fighter if you lose a fight and do not want to lose two ranks.
